** libpstiff ** 

A library for Adobe Photoshop specific TIFF Data.

Born to support me  in my attempt to  generate  TIFFs with spot  color
channels.

TIFF files  generated  by Adobe Photoshop seem  to  be  the only  pure
bitmap format on  this  planet that supports   spot color channels  in
addition to the usual RGBA and CMYK stuff.

Adobe uses a couple  of Image Resource  Blocks stuffed into a  private
"Photoshop" Tag to store the extra information.

See:

In a first attempt my  code tries to make  sense of the Image Resource
Ids  stored in the private "Photoshop" TIFF TAG.

The  ultimate target is to  generate TIFFs  with additional spot color
channels which are properly interpreted by Photoshop.

Changes so far:

* pstiff_tool  parses  thru the Image   Resource  Blocks and dumps out
  minimal information for each ID it finds.

* Give information about  the  SpotColors associated with the   custom
  color spaces.
