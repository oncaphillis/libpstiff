** libpstiff ** 

A library for Adobe Photoshop specific TIFF Data.

Born to support me  in my attempt to  generate  TIFFs with spot  color
channels.

TIFF files  generated  by Adobe Photoshop seem  to  be  the only  pure
bitnap format on  this  planet that supports   spot color channels  in
addition to the usual RGBA and CMYK stuff.

Adobe uses a couple  of Image Resource  Blocks stuffed into a  private
"Photoshop" Tag to store the extra information.

See:

In a first attempt my  code tries to make  sense of the Image Resource
Ids  stored in the private  TAG.

The  ultimate target is to  genarete  TIFFS with additional spot color
channels which are properyly interpreted by Photoshop.

Changes do far:

* pstiff_tool  parses  thru the Image   Resource  Blocks and dumps out
  minimal information for each ID it finds.
